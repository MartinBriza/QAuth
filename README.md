Doesn't support much right now... I mean, it starts, it even authenticates... no results are put out right now.

The code's pretty messy but still good according to my WIP project standards.

TODO:

* finish the API

* clean the messages

* passwd backend

* of course there's more... i'm commiting just to have it somewhere... TBD

### Current status

Working, it's possible to use the lib for an actual application.

API not stable

Not sure what to do about the stupid PAM prompts and how to present them

### Examples

Only proofs of concept, not intended for any real usage

minimaldm - DM that just logs a user into some desktop session... both values are hard-coded into the file and they vary a lot

checkpass - PAM conversation in the terminal - yes, your password will be visible

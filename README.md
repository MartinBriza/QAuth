Doesn't support much right now... I mean, it starts, it even authenticates... no results are put out right now.

The code's pretty messy but still good according to my WIP project standards.

TODO:

* finish the API

* clean the messages

* passwd backend

* of course there's more... i'm commiting just to have it somewhere... TBD

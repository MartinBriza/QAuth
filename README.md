Doesn't support much right now... I mean, it starts, it even authenticates... We'll see about the rest

The code's pretty messy but still good compared to my other WIP projects

TODO:

* finish the API

* clean the messages

* passwd backend

* of course there's more... i'm commiting just to have it somewhere... TBD

### Current status

Working, it's possible to use the lib for an actual application.

API not stable, I don't even bother to use proper sonames so far

Not sure what to do about the stupid PAM prompts and how to present them

### Examples

Only proofs of concept, not intended for any real usage

minimaldm - DM that just logs a user into some desktop session... both values are hard-coded into the source

checkpass - PAM conversation in the terminal

qmlapp - PAM conversation in an ugly QML application

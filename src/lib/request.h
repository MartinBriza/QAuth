/**
 * \brief
 * QAuthRequest is the main class for tracking requests from the underlying auth stack
 *
 * \section description
 * Typically, when logging in, you'll receive a list containing one or two fields:
 *
 *  * First one for the username (if you didn't provide it before);
 *    hidden = false, type = LOGIN_USER, message = whatever the stack provides
 *
 *  * Second one for the user's password
 *    hidden = true, type = LOGIN_PASSWORD, message = whatever the stack provides
 *
 * It's up to you to fill the \ref QAuthPrompt::response property.
 * When all the fields are filled to your satisfaction, just trigger the \ref done 
 * slot and the response will go back to the authenticator.
 *
 * \todo Decide if it's sane to use the info messages from PAM or to somehow parse them
 * and make the password changing message into a Request::Type of some kind
